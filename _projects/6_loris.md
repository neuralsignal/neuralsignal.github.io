## Summary

Loris is a database and analysis application that is currently under development. The project is being tested, and core features are being added. Once the core features are stable, documentation for the different features will be added. Loris was originally created to provide a database system for the Behnia lab. The lab uses it for data entry, maintenance, and analysis on a daily basis. While the primary use case is for a Drosophila lab, it is flexible enough to be used by other research labs as well.
