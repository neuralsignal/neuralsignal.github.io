## Abstract

Color vision represents a vital aspect of perception that ultimately enables a wide variety of species to thrive in the natural world. However, unified methods for constructing  chromatic visual stimuli in a laboratory setting are lacking. Here, we present stimulus design methods and an accompanying programming package to efficiently probe the color space of any species in which the photoreceptor spectral sensitivities are known. Our hardware-agnostic approach incorporates photoreceptor models within the framework of the principle of univariance. This enables experimenters to identify the most effective way to combine multiple light sources to create desired distributions of light, and thus easily construct relevant stimuli for mapping the color space of an organism. We include methodology to handle uncertainty of photoreceptor spectral sensitivity as well as to optimally reconstruct hyperspectral images given recent hardware advances. Our methods support broad applications in color vision science and provide a framework for uniform stimulus designs across experimental systems.
