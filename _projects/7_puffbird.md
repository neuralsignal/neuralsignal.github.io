## Summary

Puffbird is an open-source library that extends the functionality of pandas DataFrames by providing a user-friendly interface for handling complex data structures with multiple nested cells. The library has been developed with a focus on ease of use and follows the documentation style of pandas. While some of the features in puffbird have become redundant with the addition of new functionalities such as the `explode` method in pandas, the library continues to provide a valuable extension to pandas. The project is actively maintained, albeit at an irregular rate, and welcomes contributions from the community.
