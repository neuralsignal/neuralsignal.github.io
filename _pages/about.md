I am a healthcare AI researcher and innovator focused on connecting advanced machine learning with real-world medical care. As Chief AI Architect and Scientist at Mountain Biometrics (MTN) and Adjunct Faculty at the University of Utah, I am dedicated to developing AI systems that improve patient care and help clinicians make better decisions. My background in computational neuroscience at Columbia University led me to healthcare AI, where I work to make complex technology useful and accessible in clinical settings. I specialize in time-series analysis and medical AI, aiming to create reliable solutions for both clinicians and patients.

When I am not working on my data and software projects, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors via gradient descent, playing board games with friends, and dancing salsa and the waltz.
My long-term goal is to apply my skills in data and mathematical modeling to automate complex processes and gain a deeper understanding of how we interpret the world around us.

**Gucky** [’ɡʊki] is my nickname and is derived from the colloquial German verb "gucken", which means "to look".
